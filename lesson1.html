    <h2>What is Airbnb?</h2>
    <p>Airbnb is a global online platform that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people looking for accommodations. It was founded in 2008 and has since revolutionized how people travel, making it possible to book unique stays almost anywhere in the world.</p>

    <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>As a <strong>guest</strong>, you search for a place to stay, review listings, and book directly through the app or website.</li>
      <li>As a <strong>host</strong>, you list your property (even just a room), set your prices, and accept guests with flexibility and control.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Benefits of Using Airbnb</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Access to millions of unique homes, apartments, and rooms</li>
      <li>Easy communication between hosts and guests</li>
      <li>Secure booking and payment system</li>
      <li>Opportunities to earn extra income as a host</li>
    </ul>
